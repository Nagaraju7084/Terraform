1.when we use module, no need of tfvars file
developer who can execute this module who will get the tfvars file
so removing the tfvars file from this module i.e. ec2_instance module

2.any developer can create a file called main.tf under root folder i.e. terraform 170724 and will write
provider and instead of resource developer will use module
see main.tf file in root folder

3.after writing main.tf file then execute the terraform project
